                    <ul>
                        <li>The first official virus created. This virus,
                        however, was not intended to cause havoc. It was specifically
                        created to test if a program can replicate itself and be
                        passed to another computer system. When it successfully
                        appeared in a computer, it would display the message:
                        "I'M THE CREEPER. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN!"</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Rabbit</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This virus would replicate files non-stop, resulting in a overload
                        of the system's performance and crashing the computer.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Trojan</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Like it's namesake, this virus would be under the guise
                        of a given program, while hiding another program without
                        the user knowing of it. This hidden program could range
                        from being backdoors to the computer system to being effective
                        spyware.</li>

                <li></li>
