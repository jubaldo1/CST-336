            <p class = "para">Viruses had been around almost as long as the computer had
            been around. The idea of a computer virus had originally been produced
            in the 1940s and 1960s through John von Neumann's "Theory of Self-Producing Automata".</p>
            
            <p class = "para">As the title suggests, the idea was that a program
            could be created to act similarily to an organic virus, ready to replicate
            and pass itself on to other hosts.</p>
